Pyrobot is a small Twitter bot designed by [@mlugg][mlugg] and [@vktec][vktec].
It uses the [FLAM3 algorithm][flam3] by Scott Draves to generate abstract
images. Every hour, the most popular images (calculated with `(likes +
retweets) / days since posted`) are selected, and their genomes bred together
to produce a new flame.

This is similar to the way [The Electric Sheep][esheep] functions, except
applied to still images rather than animations.

Check out PyroBot on [Twitter][birdsite] and [GitHub][code].
