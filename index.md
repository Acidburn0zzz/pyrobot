Pyrobot is a small Twitter bot designed by [@mlugg][mlugg] and [@vktec][vktec].
It uses the [FLAM3 algorithm][flam3] by Scott Draves to generate abstract
images. The genomes of these images are then bred together based on popularity
(`(likes + retweets) / days since posted`) to produce 10 new images.

Check out PyroBot on [Twitter][birdsite] and [GitHub][code]
